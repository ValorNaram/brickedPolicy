<img src="trufi.app/screenshots/feat-journeyplanning.png" />
<p>The heart of the app is its ability to allow you to specify a starting point you are going from and an destination point you want to travel to to let it make suggestions which path to use.</p>
<p>In order to do that the app sends the following information to our server:</p>
<ul>
<li>the origin you specified</li>
<li>the destination you specified</li> 
<li>your current IP address</li>
<li>the version of the app installed on your phone</li>
<li>date and time of your request</li>
<p>These information are necessary to provide this feature and to troubleshoot problems e.g. users using an outdated version of our app</p>
</ul>
